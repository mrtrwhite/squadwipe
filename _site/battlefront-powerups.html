			<p>With Star Wars: Battlefront having been in the public domain for almost half a year now, it’s been interesting to see how the press have reported on its two DLC launches and whether gamers have returned to the old favourites, or stuck it out and endured the changes. Of course, much like DICE has done with Battlefield, many of the game’s weapons have been made less powerful under the banner of ‘balancing’. For many I think this has been a major deterrent, especially for new players.</p>

<p>The internet’s response to the game’s first DLC download ‘The Battle of Jakku’ was a great big ‘meh’, and the newest release ‘Outer Rim’ doesn’t seem to have stirred a great deal of interest (with no new Walker Assault maps), but I think there’s still hope left in the galaxy for this franchise, especially with ‘bonus points weekends’, and ‘Jabba the Hut contracts’. For me, Battlefront is still a hell of alot of fun with a friend or two, and acts as a nice entrée into other games.</p>

<p>In addition to blasters and ‘cards’, Battlefront’s special purchasable weapons (grenades, torpedoes, snipers etc), the game also features ‘power-ups’ that can be found (seemingly randomly) scattered around maps. They can often be the difference between taking down an AT-AT and winning the round, or losing and incredibly useful when used strategically. Each power-up has a specific (and usually fairly obvious) purpose.</p>

<p>The power-ups that probably don’t require much explanation are the thermal imploder, a high explosive grenade-of-sorts, and the blaster cannon, a simple turret with front-facing shield. The thermal imploder is immensely effective when used on clusters of infantry and will obliterate anything within a ~5m spread of itself. Remember to follow the explosion with blaster fire to assure your success. The cannon is really only useful against infantry in confined spaces, like the corridors on Hoth.</p>

<p>The other deployable explosive in addition to the thermal imploder, is the proximity bomb (think claymores in Battlefield 4). The proximity bomb is best used in funnels the enemy are bound to pass through, like doorways, trenches and crevasses. Although I’ve never seen the proximity bomb kill more than a single soldier, its splash damage does mean it’s possible to score multiple kills with follow up fire. I usually place my proximity bombs and forget about them, only to score a kill later in the round. A nice addition, but by no means the most powerful.</p>

<p>The autonomous power-ups (ones that you can leave to do the killing) include a sensor droid (which comes in Empire and Rebel variants), infantry turret, and the vehicle turret.</p>

<div class="quote-block container-constrained">
	<blockquote class="inline h1">

	</blockquote>
</div>

<p>The Empire variant of the sensor droid fires lasers at a relatively low rate that take about 20% health. The Rebel variant simply scans its vicinity for enemies. The droids are most useful if you’re trying to defend an objective and are being attacked from multiple sides. While neither deal substantial damage, their thick armour ensures an attacking player’s presence will be known to your teammates should they try to destroy it.</p>

<p>The infantry turret is one of the most underrated power-ups in the game. While its range isn’t so great, when placed in a strategically important position the turret can allow a player to get several kills. A favourite play of mine is to place the turret in one of the many cutthroughs, just behind the middle ridgeline on Tattooine. The turret’s effectiveness here lies in the fact that the enemy can’t see it before they’re in its range.</p>

<p>The purpose of the vehicle turret, although harder to place than the infantry turret is to destroy AT-AT and AT-STs. Because AT-ATs follow a predictable path, it’s most likely that you’ll place it well before the vehicle is within range. Be sure to conceal its location so that it can’t be spotted by infantry and destroyed. On Endor, Walker Assault, the vehicle turret is ideally placed along the river that spans the map. On Hoth, try placing the turret in a trench, out of sight.</p>

<p>The power-up that Battlefront players yearn to use most is the Orbital Strike, probably because of its perceived damage. Players are given a pair of electrobinoculars and a hail of lasers will splash down on the area they designate. The orbital strike is a little overrated, and has been weakened since launch but is still effective on maps with wide spaces with no cover (not Jakku or Endor). Be aware of the fact that the opposing team are warned before an incoming strike and will move out of the way of its destruction. However, the weapon is immensely destructive when used on AT-ATs on Walker Assault while their shields are down. The real skill in using the Orbital Strike is in waiting for the opportune moment to strike. Be patient.</p>

    </div>
	<div class="close"></div>
</div>

<p>The last two power-ups are the smart rocket and squad shield. The former serves very much the same purpose as the vehicle turret. A direct hit to the disk-shape on the front of an AT-AT will most likely give you an assist should your team bring it down - the same goes for the AT-ST. The latter is best used when attacking an objective, but not on the objective itself. The flaw in this power-up that most new players don’t realise is that grenades can pass easily through it and explode within. Additionally, the opposing team will often breach and shield and attempt a melee. Deploy the shield when an orbital strike is incoming and there’s no obvious cover or when you need 360 degree protection from snipers and vehicles - a good example of this being the closing stages of Walker Assault and Turning Point on Tattooine.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that power-ups should ultimately be used in the context of a greater team strategy. Coordinate with your squadmates and use the above tactics to secure kills, play the objective and ultimately have fun.</p>
