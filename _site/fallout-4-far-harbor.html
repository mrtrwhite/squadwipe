			<p>For me Fallout 4 was a game that, despite the hype that was built up around its release, didn’t astound me, nor disappoint. Some of the pieces were there: an expansive world full of characters each with their own backstories and motives, an immersive storyline with plot twists at every turn and weapon and armor mods galore, but often the game’s negatives outweighed its redeeming qualities: frequent crashes causing players to lose progress, repetitive side quests with no end in sight and enemies with ridiculously better equipment and/or strength.</p>

<p>There’s no denying though, Fallout 4 definitely had its moments. In a nostalgic way, that I sometimes look back on the games I’ve played with, I replay the adventures I had with Nick Valentine in my head with a sort of sentimentality that I don’t feel with other games. It’s probably for this reason that, despite all the failings the original game had, I decided to give Bethesda’s new ‘Far Harbor’ DLC a go.</p>

<p>After checking on the home screen under ‘add-ons’ that it’s installed we can start. While beginning as a missing child case taken on by Valentine’s Detective Agency in Diamond City, Far Harbor’s story evolves into one that echoes other Fallout games - a conflict between warring factions that our character inevitably becomes a part of. There are the Children of Atom, worshippers of a religion built around the dropping of the atomic bomb (whom we’ve met before), Acadia a population of synths (or humans) undergoing identity crises and of course residents of Far Harbor, a population clinging on to remnants of a once established island.</p>

</div>

<p>If you enjoyed the complex decision-making that Fallout 4’s central narrative thrusted players into, there’s no shortage in Far Harbor. How your own character’s story pans out is entirely dependent upon his or her own sense of identity and values. Is there such a thing as the ‘greater good’? Can you make the necessary sacrifices to survive? Far Harbor also very cleverly plays on the concept of a synth’s place in society, a theme that’s been core to Fallout 4 throughout. It couldn’t more perfectly reflect our own society in which the possibility of free-thinking artificial intelligence is no longer science fiction.</p>

<p>About halfway through Far Harbor’s main missions, players are tasked with unlocking a character’s memories in an entirely self-contained Minecraft-like, Portal-esque puzzle game. Don’t be surprised if this chapter in the story frustrates you. Fortunately Bethesda keeps the game mode challenging enough to hold one’s attention, and the audio snippets these ‘memories’ contain are gold. <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2016/05/20/fallout-4s-far-harbor-murders-its-momentum-with-a-maddening-puzzle-sequence/#7f6c282641e4">Critics have slammed</a> these missions for detracting from the momentum of the main storyline, but I felt it broke things up nicely in the sense that I had to re-acquaint myself with the mechanics of the game once I eventually returned to the wasteland.</p>

<p>If you’re aspiring to achieve 100% completion of ‘Far Harbor’, I’d advise you clear your calendar for the next month. While it’s possible to complete the main storyline within about 10 hours (other critics suggest 12, my experience differs), the Far Harbor DLC has no shortage of side missions and quests that lead to better loot and experience to spend on skills. If you’re the investigative type, there’s a hilarious murder-mystery-style quest in the island’s only vault under the Cliff’s Edge Hotel, but Far Harbor certainly won’t leave you short of anything to do. Completing the last ‘memory’ puzzle discussed above also reveals the locations of military-grade weapons and armour on the map (in sequence) - very useful if you come up against any Mirlurks.</p>

<p>One of the great additions to Fallout 4 was the concept of companions, AI characters you can bring along for the ride. While Nick Valentine’s depressive demeanour adds to the seriousness of the situation, ‘Old Longfellow’ a character you meet relatively early on, instilled a sense of confidence in me as I navigated the wasteland. Perhaps I have daddy issues, or Longfellow’s shotgun is just more powerful than other characters’, but get into a heavy firefight and don’t expect the old guy to stay up for long (no pun intended). In addition to Far Harbor’s companions, the DLC brings an array of weapons and customisations, although I’m certainly a big fan of the Harpoon Gun which I bought in Far Harbor itself. Expect to kill pesky Super Mutants in two (or sometimes one) shots as you watch metal bolts splatter their guts in slow motion.</p>

<p>I hadn’t envisioned myself returning to the Fallout 4 universe, but if you already own the game I’d definitely recommend downloading a copy of Far Harbor. The mechanics of the game largely feel the same, but the DLC’s slow burn and suspense forced me to want to find answers and commit time, not feel overwhelmed. Enjoy the ride.</p>
