For me Fallout 4 was a game that, despite the hype that was built up around its release, didn't astound me, nor disappoint. Some of the pieces were there: an expansive world full of characters each with their own backstories and motives, an immersive storyline with plot twists at every turn and weapon and armor mods galore, but often the game's negatives outweighed its redeeming qualities: frequent crashes causing players to lose progress, repetitive side quests with no end in sight, enemies with ridiculously better equipment and/or strength.

There's no denying though, Fallout 4 definitely had its moments. In a nostalgic way, that I sometimes look back on the games I've played, I replay the adventures I had with Nick Valentine in my head with a sort of sentimentality that I don't feel with other games. It's probably for this reason that, despite all the failings the original game had, I decided to give Bethesda's new 'Far Harbor' DLC a go.

After downloading the DLC and checking on the home screen under 'add-ons' that it's installed we can begin. While beginning as a missing child case taken on by Valentine's Detective Agency, Far Harbor's story evolves into one that echoes other Fallout games - a conflict between warring factions that our character inevitably becomes a part of. There are the Children of Atom, worshippers of a religion built around the dropping of the atomic bomb, Acadia a population of synths (or humans) undergoing identity crises and of course residents of Far Harbor, a population clinging on to remnants of a once great island.
