This past weekend I had the opportunity to return to a game that I didn't feel particularly strongly about upon release. Fallout 4 was a game that, despite the hype that built up arounds its release, didn't astound me, nor disappoint. Some of the pieces were there: an expansive world full of characters each with their own backstories and motives, an immersive storyline with plot twists at every turn and weapon and armor mods galore, but often the game's negatives outweighed its redeeming qualities: frequent crashes causing players to lose progress, repetitive side quests with no end in sight, enemies with ridiculously better equipment and/or strength.

Don't get me wrong, Fallout 4 was by no means a bad game. I sometimes think about the great times I shared with synth (synthetic, or robot) detective Nick Valentine with a sort of hazy giddiness. There were some extraordinary moments that I often didn't expect, and plot points that resonated on varying emotional and topical scales, like that of a robot's place or identity in society - something that will most likely become a reality for the people of our own universe. But Fallout 4 also contained a lot of repetition - repeatedly I'd find my character trudging through bleak landscapes with only a handful of rounds, carrying out side missions to no clear end, with half the Wasteland's beasts waiting for me around each corner.

As with almost all the other Fallout stories, we're forced to side with a faction in a conflict that isn't ours. In New Vegas this would have been the NCR, Caesar's Legion, or Mr House. In Fallout 4's main story this would have been the Brotherhood of Steel, The Institute, The Minutemen, and the Railroad. In Far Harbor, we can side with the Children of Atom, worshippers of a religion built around the dropping of the atomic bomb, Acadia a population of synths (or humans, you decide), and of course residents of Far Harbor, a population clinging on to 'The Island' for survival. And with all titles, there's a prophet-like leader pulling the strings behind closed doors.
