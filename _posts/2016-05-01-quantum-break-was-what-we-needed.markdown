And boy, did it deliver.

Quantum Break has been out on the Xbox One for about a month now, and during that period I've had the opportunity to replay it to my heart's content. As a result, I've been able to identify what I really like about it, and what's not so great. A major pitfall to the game however, _is_ its replayability and much like all great narratives, it's hard to re-experience something that was so memorable in the first instance. Quantum break is a game that certainly doesn't play like anything _I've_ played before but if forced to, I might compare it to Max Payne 3 (another title by the creators, Remedy Entertainment), or weirdly, Star Wars Battlefront (bear with me on this one).

The title represents Microsoft's continued drive towards creating content [exclusive to its own platforms](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/10/9880594/microsoft-xbox-games-2016-interview-crackdown-3-quantum-break-recore). Not only is it exceptionally well-written, with brilliant acting from Shawn Ashmore and Game of Thrones actor Aidan Gillen, but it's beautifully lit and styled. In fact Quantum Break is a game that has its own very distinct visual style, both in gameplay and menus, which although as gamers we don't talk about much, is very important to us.

What really struck me about Quantum Break is the extent of characterisation. It's something that forces us to develop a strong bond with the game's key characters (including its protagonist Jack Joyce) and that Remedy really got right this time. While the script certainly contributes to this, as does the mesmerising acting by all, at certain key points we're also forced to make decisions that will determine the path a character chooses and consequently decide the course the game takes. Science fiction storylines often fall apart when inconsistencies become apparent, but this title really holds its own. At no point did I feel that what I'd seen didn't correspond to the world that had been laid out before us.

At first glance, Quantum Break _looks_ like a third-person shooter, but that couldn't be further from the truth. The game actually doesn't _feel_ like a shooter at all, and much of our protagonist's power lies in his abilities, which allow us to find ways around enemies, slow them down, and kill them. While initially I found myself relying on a single ability, I found that it was possible to create 'recipes' for taking down multiple enemies - combinations for different situations. In this sense, the game didn't feel repetitive or button-mashy and gave me the freedom to challenge myself and play in a way that others might not. Despite this I did find ultimately that we're reliant upon guns to kill enemies, which often feel so dissatisfyingly weak and inaccurate.

What you might have already read about Quantum Break is that following these key decisions, if downloaded, we're given a 30 minute episode of the game's 'TV show'. Of the times I've played through the game, I've only watched these episodes once, although I've been told that the episode you get to watch is based on the decision you make.
I didn't feel they contributed much to the game's central narrative, mostly because they follow a storyline that runs in parallel and is related to, but doesn't affect that of the main characters (for the most part). I also felt quite aware that what I was watching wasn't TV or an on-demand programme, but that was 'low-key', echoing something like the Halo web-series 'Forward Unto Dawn'. Despite this and the 75GB file download involved, these episodes make for an enjoyable ride.

I probably don't have to mention it, but as you nay have guessed Quantum Break's visuals are a gift to behold. This manifests itself in the environments Jack navigates through: crumbling buildings, a ship tearing through a bridge, a falling crane, all in a state of either stopped in time (in so-called 'stutters' in which only our protagonist can traverse) or in motion; thousands of particles tracked in space. Some of these destructive environments even involve puzzles that sometimes require a little thought to pass through.

In addition, Jack's surroundings will often contain collectibles, recordings and messages that further shed light on the main story. These are largely worth taking the time to read and enjoy, whether they be email exchanges between main and peripheral characters, or documents referring to a backstory event. Equally as impressive is the motion tracking and model detail. Every motion in Jack's movement, every flash of anger in his expression is identifiable  - I often found myself having to replay footage to ascertain whether it's real or not.

Quantum Break is proof that the traditional story-driven campaign has a large place in gaming. While the visuals are impressive, the title's well-written script, extraordinary acting, and overall execution make it stand head and shoulders above other games in the genre. Highly recommended.
