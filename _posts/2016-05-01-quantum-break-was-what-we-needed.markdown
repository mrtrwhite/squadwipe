And boy, did it deliver.

Quantum Break has been out on the Xbox One for about a month now, and during that period we've had the opportunity to replay it to our heart's content. It's a game that certainly doesn't play like anything _I've_ played before but if forced to, I might compare it to Max Payne 3, or weirdly, Star Wars Battlefront (bear with me on this one).

Quantum Break represent Microsoft's continued push towards creating game content [exclusive to its own platforms](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/10/9880594/microsoft-xbox-games-2016-interview-crackdown-3-quantum-break-recore). Not only is it exceptionally well-written, with brilliant acting from Shawn Ashmore and Game of Thrones actor Aidan Gillen, but it's beautifully lit and styled. In fact Quantum Break is a game that has its own very distinct visual style, both in gameplay and menus, which although as gamers we don't talk about much, is very important to us.
