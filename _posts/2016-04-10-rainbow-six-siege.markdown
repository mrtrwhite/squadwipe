With the price having come down significantly since its launch, you can now buy Rainbow Six Siege on the main consoles for about £20 (~$28). To the average FPS gamer, this might seem like a good deal. The round-based shooter, published by Ubisoft, received a modest 7.9/10 from IGN and 8 on Gamespot.

In total honesty this wasn't a game that I was hugely interested in playing on launch, but having watched the gameplay of Youtubers like Jackfrags, Rainbow Six Siege seemed like something I'd enjoy and potentially be good at. It has a large array of weapons upgrades and customisations, a selection of characters each with their own special abilities designed for different play styles, and the kind of fast-paced, close-quarters combat synonymous with Counter Strike: Global Offensive.

The format is round-based, team gameplay, where to die means to sit out of the round until the next. I won't lie, this can be hugely unforgiving but when you're the last team-member the pressure is exhilarating. It is however a formula that we've seen before, but not in this level of detail and with such diverse, destructible environments.

But a number of issues plague the Rainbow Six experience. While many games give new players an arsenal of tools to help them rank up, or points to spend help them quickly buy new modifications, Rainbow Six Siege starts players on the most basic 'Recruit' character with no points and inaccurate, low-damage guns to start with. Because of this, players ultimately have to play for several hours before they have enough points to buy a new character. I went for 'Sledge' an SAS soldier with a clichéd British accent and sledgehammer that can smash through walls.

The problem with this however is that only one player per team can play as a particular character, meaning if the character you decided to spend your hard-earned points on has already been picked by a teammate, you're back to square one. It's also hard to know which characters are less popular, and therefore have lower odds of getting picked, and which characters' upgrades offer the best value. There's likely to be a correlation.

Another major issue is that of players leaving a game lobby before it starts. Because there's such a great emphasis on teamwork, flanking and strategy, a team of two or three players is massively disadvantaged against one of five. And what's more, no penalties are brought against players who do this. One can only draw comparisons with a game-mode like 'Breakout' in Halo 5, in which players are served warnings or even bans for quitting multiple games in a short space of time. One can't help but feel like the game's makers should have been a little more realistic and put restrictions in place to prevent this. Of the first ten games I played, this happened four times - I imagine my fellow teammates saw how low a level I was decided we were already fucked from the get-go.

Another, although perhaps less obvious issue is that to coordinate a strategy against the other team really requires some kind of communication. The majority of console gamers still don't regularly use headsets, and you can hardly blame them. I actually came across a surprisingly few number of players with mics (about 1 in 10) and this only created the impression that other players didn't want to help, not that they weren't able to. In fairness, RB6S does allow players to set markers and spot other players on the map, and killed players can use CCTV to identify enemy team members.

While I really wanted to enjoy Rainbow Six Siege, I found that several underlying flaws prevented me from getting into it, notably the ability to abandon the lobby before a game starts without penalty. I therefore can't guarantee that if you're a fan of CS:GO or round-based gameplay you'll enjoy this too. RB6S is a game for the hardcore FPS-ers but can be incredibly unforgiving if you expect to be able to rank up like you can in other successful franchises. But there's no denying, those environments are practically works of destructible, chaotic art.
